## Using Hive

#### Install and set up Hive

ssh to your cloud computer and switch to the hduser. Go to the hduser's home.

```bash
$ su hduser
$ cd
```
Let's download Hive.

```bash
$ wget http://apache.mirrors.pair.com/hive/hive-2.3.2/apache-hive-2.3.2-bin.tar.gz
```
This is a zipped file. Extract it.

```bash
$ tar -xzvf apache-hive-2.3.2-bin.tar.gz 
```
Now, in hduser's home directory, you have a directory called `apache-hive-2.3.2-bin`.
We are going to edit your `.bashrc` file to make an environment varible called HIVE_HOME
so that Hadoop and Hive know where it lives (like we did with the Hadoop setup).

```bash
$ emacs ~/.bashrc
```
To the end of the `.bashrc` file that we are editing, add the following lines

```bash
export HIVE_HOME=/home/hduser/apache-hive-2.3.2-bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HIVE_HOME/bin
```
Save and close. Now we need to run the `.bashrc` to make sure HIVE_HOME is defined.

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
That's it. Now we installed Hive. We have one last setup step left.
Hive basically behaves like a SQL database that lives on the hdfs.
To be able to do that, it needs a temporary files folder and a place to store the underlying data (in the hdfs).
We need to create these directories in the hdfs and give the necessary permissions.
> Obviously, to be able to make changes to the hdfs, make sure your hadoop cluster is up and running.
> Do `jps` to check if the namenode, secondary namenode and the datanode are up.
> If not, you need to start them with the `start-dfs.sh` first, you can check to hadoop tutorial to see how we did that.

```bash
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tmp
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse
$ hdfs dfs -chmod g+w /tmp
$ hdfs dfs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse
```
Set Hadoop path in hive-env.sh

```bash
$ cd apache-hive-2.3.2-bin/
$ emacs conf/hive-env.sh
```
Add the following lines

```bash
# Set HADOOP_HOME to point to a specific hadoop install directory
export HADOOP_HOME=/home/hduser/hadoop-3.0.0

export HADOOP_HEAPSIZE=512

# Hive Configuration Directory can be controlled by:
export HIVE_CONF_DIR=/home/hduser/apache-hive-2.3.2-bin/conf
```
Edit hive-site.xml
```bash
$ emacs conf/hive-site.xml
```
Add the following lines
```bash

```
By default, Hive uses Derby database. Initialize Derby database.
```
$ bin/schematool -initSchema -dbType derby
```
Note: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35655306/hive-installation-issues-hive-metastore-database-is-not-initialized
Before you run hive for the first time, run
```
schematool -initSchema -dbType derby
```
If you already ran hive and then tried to initSchema and it's failing:
```
mv metastore_db metastore_db.tmp
```
Re run
```
schematool -initSchema -dbType derby
```
Run hive again

Aaand, your Hive is ready to rock your world. You can run it by typing

```
$ hive
```
You should get a hive prompt, like this:

```
hive> _
```
Hive's syntax is (almost) identical to SQL. So let's load up some data and use it. First, exit:

```
hive> exit;
```

#### Download some baseball data to play with

You should be back at your regular prompt now. Let's download some baseball data.
```bash
$ wget http://seanlahman.com/files/database/lahman-csv_2014-02-14.zip
```
This is a zipped file with a bunch of csv files, each is a sql table.
These tables are full of baseball statistics from 2013. Let's unzip this.
First we need to switch back to a user with sudo powers so we can install unzip, 
then switch back to hduser and unzip it.
(Of course, switch `nuttha` below with your own username)

```bash
$ su nuttha
$ sudo apt-get install unzip
$ su hduser
$ mkdir baseballdata
$ unzip lahman-csv_2014-02-14.zip -d baseballdata
```

#### First look & cleanup of the data

Now you have a bunch of csv files in the `baseballdata` directory.
You can think of each csv as a table in a baseball database.
Let's create one Hive table and read a csv into that table.
This is the exact analog of loading a csv into a sql table.
Let's do this with the `baseballdata/Master.csv`.
First, take a look at that csv file.

```bash
$ head baseballdata/Master.csv
```

You should see this:

```Text
playerID,birthYear,birthMonth,birthDay,birthCountry,birthState,birthCity,deathYear,deathMonth,deathDay,deathCountry,deathState,deathCity,nameFirst,nameLast,nameGiven,weight,height,bats,throws,debut,finalGame,retroID,bbrefID

```

Ok. We need to create at table with these following column headers.
To be able to read it better, let's print each column name in a line.
```bash
$ head -n 1 baseballdata/Master.csv | tr ',' '\n'
```
You should see

```Text
playerID
birthYear
birthMonth
birthDay
birthCountry
birthState
birthCity
deathYear
deathMonth
deathDay
deathCountry
deathState
deathCity
nameFirst
nameLast
nameGiven
weight
height
bats
throws
debut
finalGame
retroID
bbrefID
```
What did we do up there? `head` shows us only several lines at the beginning of a file.
The option `-n 1` tells it to show only the first line (`-n 5` would have shown the first five).
The output of this is a line of column headers separated by commas.
We pipe this output into `tr ',' '\n'`, which converts (or *tr*anslates) every `,` character into a newline character (`\n`).
That way, we get a new line every time there was a comma.
Ok, great. This will help us construct the table.
One last thing we need to do is to remove the first line from the file, though, to make it easier to upload it to Hive.
We can use `tail` for this, which, just like head, only shows several lines of a file, but the **last** lines instead of the first.
`tail -n 4` shows the last 4 lines, for example. `tail -n +8` shows all lines including and after the 8th line.
So, to get rid of the first line, we want `tail -n +2`. Let's pipe the output into head to check if it will indeed work:

```bash
$ tail -n +2 baseballdata/Master.csv | head
```
should show
```Text

```
Looks like it's working. So let's write this into a temporary file and then overwrite the original with this new temp file so Master.csv no longer has the header line.
```bash
$ tail -n +2 baseballdata/Master.csv > tmp && mv tmp baseballdata/Master.csv
```
The `&&` means do the first part first, and when it finished, do what follows the `&&`.

Ok. we removed the header. Let's make sure we did
```bash
$ head baseballdata/Master.csv
aardsda01,1981,12,27,USA,CO,Denver,,,,,,,David,Aardsma,David Allan,205,75,R,R,2004-04-06,2013-09-28,aardd001,aardsda01

#### Upload data to Hive

Indeed it's gone. Alright. Let's upload this to hive. First, we need to upload it to hdfs.
(of course, change `nuttha` to whichever directory you have in hdfs) 
```bash
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/nuttha/baseballdata
$ hdfs dfs -put baseballdata/Master.csv /user/nuttha/baseballdata
```
We created a new directory in hsfs and uploaded the csv to it.
Let's make sure it's there.
```bash
$ hdfs dfs -ls /user/nuttha/baseballdata
Found 1 items
-rw-r--r--   1 hduser supergroup    2422684 2015-03-11 22:12 /user/nuttha/baseballdata/Master.csv
```
It is. Awesome. Time to run hive
```bash
$ hive

Logging initialized using configuration in jar:file:/home/hduser/apache-hive-0.14.0-bin/lib/hive-common-0.14.0.jar!/hive-log4j.properties

SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]  
hive> 
```
We now have the Hive prompt. (Ignore the SLF4J warning, it's an unimportant logging thing).
Let's create the table

```sql
hive> CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Master
      (playerID STRING,
      birthYear INT,
      birthMonth INT,
      birthDay INT,
      birthCountry STRING,
      birthState STRING,
      birthCity STRING,
      deathYear INT,
      deathMonth INT,
      deathDay INT,
      deathCountry STRING,
      deathState STRING,
      deathCity STRING,
      nameFirst STRING,
      nameLast STRING,
      nameGiven STRING,
      weight INT,
      height INT,
      bats STRING,
      throws STRING,
      debut STRING,
      finalGame STRING,
      retroID STRING,
      bbrefID STRING)
      COMMENT 'Master Player Table'
      ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
      FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
      STORED AS TEXTFILE;
OK
Time taken: 1.752 seconds
```
And let's load the data
```sql
hive> LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/nuttha/baseballdata/Master.csv' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE Master;
Loading data to table default.master
Table default.master stats: [numFiles=1, numRows=0, totalSize=2422684, rawDataSize=0]
OK
Time taken: 1.166 seconds
```
And it's in!

#### Use Hive to make queries over the distributed data

We now have a Hive table. The best part of hive is, when you make a query (that most of the time looks **exactly** like a sql query), Hive automatically creates the map and reduce tasks, runs them over the hadoop cluster, and gives you the answer, without you having to worry about any of it. If your question is easily represented in the form of a sql query, Hive will take care of all the dirty work for you. The table might be spread over thousands of computers, but you don't need to think hard about that at all.

Let's start easy. Let's find out how many players we have in this table.
```sql
hive> SELECT COUNT(playerid) FROM Master;
Query ID = hduser_20150311224646_00211363-82a3-49f0-aac2-b0d6abb4caf9
Total jobs = 1
Launching Job 1 out of 1
Number of reduce tasks determined at compile time: 1
In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
  set hive.exec.reducers.max=<number>
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
  set mapreduce.job.reduces=<number>
Job running in-process (local Hadoop)
Hadoop job information for Stage-1: number of mappers: 0; number of reducers: 0
2015-03-11 22:46:52,488 Stage-1 map = 100%,  reduce = 100%
Ended Job = job_local747935831_0002
MapReduce Jobs Launched: 
Stage-Stage-1:  HDFS Read: 9690750 HDFS Write: 0 SUCCESS
Total MapReduce CPU Time Spent: 0 msec
OK
18354
Time taken: 2.424 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
```
As you can see, hive reports on the job it is setting up and the map reduce tasks that job entails, reports on the progress, and finally gives the result: There are 18354 players.

Let's do something that would require more involved mapper and reducer functions, but is pretty straightforward with Hive. Let's get the weight distribution of the players in this table.
```sql
hive> SELECT weight, count(playerID) FROM Master GROUP BY weight;
Query ID = hduser_20150311223636_6eda794b-8400-4054-9fce-b1080af16f99
Total jobs = 1
Launching Job 1 out of 1
Number of reduce tasks not specified. Estimated from input data size: 1
In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
  set hive.exec.reducers.max=<number>
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
  set mapreduce.job.reduces=<number>
Job running in-process (local Hadoop)
Hadoop job information for Stage-1: number of mappers: 0; number of reducers: 0
2015-03-11 22:36:44,510 Stage-1 map = 0%,  reduce = 0%
2015-03-11 22:36:45,753 Stage-1 map = 100%,  reduce = 0%
2015-03-11 22:36:46,797 Stage-1 map = 100%,  reduce = 100%
Ended Job = job_local1584830750_0001

As you can see, a simple GROUP BY statement takes care of everything. Easier than writing and executing specific mapreduce functions.

In this manner, you can do sql-like queries over tons of data that live in the hdfs in a distributed state. Since hdfs and mapreduce have overheads, it will not be as fast as a sql query on data that fits a single machine, but you now get the answers in parallel, and are able to do sql queries over hundreds of terabytes of data.

#### Join example in Hive

Let's upload another table and see how joins work. Salaries.csv has four columns: year, team, league, player, salary. It only has salary information for after 1984, but it's pretty extensive.

Let's remove the header and upload it to hdfs
```bash
hive> exit;
$ tail -n +2 baseballdata/Salaries.csv > tmp && mv tmp baseballdata/Salaries.csv
$ hdfs dfs -put baseballdata/Salaries.csv /user/nuttha/baseballdata
```
Switch to hive, create the table and load the data.
```sql
$ hive

Mission accomplished. We have two tables now: `Master` and `Salaries`. (By the way, you should have noticed by now that nothing in Hive is case sensitive).

Let's do a somewhat more complicated query that involves two tables. Let's take a look at the upper end of the weight distribution among the players and their salaries. Here is the breakdown of the query:
>
> ```sql
> SELECT Salaries.yearID, Master.nameFirst, Master.nameLast, Master.weight, Salaries.salary
> ```
> This is what we want to read: The first & last name of the player, their weight, and their salary at a specific year. Salary and year comes from the salary table and the rest from the master table.
>
> ```sql
> FROM Master JOIN Salaries ON (Master.playerID = Salaries.playerID)
> ```
> This is how we combine the information from both tables. We want the row for a player to connect with the salary rows for that player. Note that there are multiple rows for the same player in the Salaries table (for multiple years).
>
> ```sql
> WHERE Master.weight > 270;
> ```
> Only show the players who weigh more than 270 pounds. Also note that we don't have yearly weights, but a single weight statistic for each player (that is reported in the Master table).
>

So, let's put this query together and execute it.
```sql
hive> SELECT Salaries.yearID, Master.nameFirst, Master.nameLast, Master.weight, Salaries.salary FROM Master JOIN Salaries ON (Master.playerID = Salaries.playerID) WHERE Master.weight > 270;

Done. By joining tables, you can build some pretty complicated queries, which Hive will automatically execute with MapReduce.
